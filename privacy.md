Of course. This is a critical step for your store submission.

A good privacy policy for an extension like yours should be clear, honest, and directly address the data it handles. The main selling point and trust factor for your extension is that **all data is stored locally**, and you need to make that incredibly clear.

Here is a `privacy.md` file that you can use. It is written in Markdown, which is perfect for hosting on GitHub Pages. Just copy this content into a new `privacy.md` file in your project's repository.

# Privacy Policy for Metadata Wizard

**Effective Date:** August 26, 2025

Thank you for using Metadata Wizard, a browser extension designed for web developers and testers. This privacy policy outlines how the extension handles data. Your privacy and data security are our highest priority.

The core principle of Metadata Wizard is that **all of your data is your own**.

---

### 1. Information We Handle

Metadata Wizard is a developer tool that, by its nature, needs to interact with your browsing data to function. The types of information it handles are:

- **Network Request Data:** This includes the URLs, methods (GET, POST, etc.), request headers, request bodies, response headers, status codes, and response bodies of network requests on pages where the extension is active.
- **User-Created Overrides:** Any JSON data that you provide to create a mock response or override.
- **User-Created URL Patterns:** The URL patterns you configure to tell the extension which network requests to capture.

### 2. How We Use and Store Information

This is the most important part of our privacy policy:

**All data handled by Metadata Wizard is stored exclusively on your local computer using the built-in `chrome.storage.local` API.**

- The captured network requests are stored so you can view, inspect, and create overrides from them.
- Your override data and URL patterns are stored so that your configurations are saved between browser sessions.

This local storage is private to your browser profile and cannot be accessed by other websites or extensions.

### 3. Data Transmission

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your data.**

Metadata Wizard is a fully client-side tool. It **never** sends any of the information it handles—including your request history, override data, or usage patterns—to our servers or any third-party services. All processing happens locally within your browser.

### 4. Permissions Justification

The Chrome Web Store requires a justification for the permissions requested by the extension. Here is why Metadata Wizard needs them:

- **`webRequest`**: This permission is necessary to listen to network events (like request completion) to gather metadata such as status codes and response headers.
- **`declarativeNetRequest`**: This is the core permission required to apply your user-created overrides. It allows the extension to intercept a network request and redirect it to your mock data efficiently and securely.
- **`host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]`**: Metadata Wizard is a general-purpose developer tool. It needs this permission to allow _you_, the user, to configure it to work on any website you are developing or testing. The extension does not automatically run on all pages; it only captures requests that match the URL patterns you provide.
- **`storage`**: Required to save your captured requests, custom overrides, and URL patterns locally on your machine so they persist between sessions.
- **`scripting`**: Required to inject the necessary scripts into web pages to capture response bodies, which is a core feature of the tool.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the version on the Chrome Web Store and within the extension itself.
